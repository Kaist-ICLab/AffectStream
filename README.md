# AffectStream: Kafka-based Real-time Affect Monitoring System using Wearable Sensors
Real-time affect monitoring is essential for personalized and adaptive applications in fields like education, healthcare, and customer service. However, existing systems often struggle with scalability and low-latency requirements for processing high-frequency sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose AffectStream, a Kafka-based real-time affect monitoring system that processes wearable sensor data through a cloud-based pub/sub architecture to the applications. AffectStream ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and personalized emotional state analysis. Its robust performance is demonstrated through trace-based evaluations using the WESAD dataset. This open-source framework advances real-time emotion recognition, paving the way for large-scale affective computing applications.
